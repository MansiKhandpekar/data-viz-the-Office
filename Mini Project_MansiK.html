                            If I had to choose one TV show to watch for the rest of my life, I would pick <i>The Office</i>. No doubt. It's one of the best Comedy genre series out there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This webpage would try to find answers relating to the series with the help of data visualization and try to make sense of the patterns found in those visualizations. The narrative of the analysis goes from Micro to Macro, looking at the series's ranking compared to other series of the same and mix genre and then diving deep into more behind-the-scenes explorative questions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although The Office is a well known series and doesn't need an introduction, a small brief on the show would help the unaware navigate through the web page and might even encourage them to give the series a shot.

                                The Office, is a well known American Mockumentary sitcom series that was aired on March, 2005. It portrays an Office setting and documents its employees day-to-day fictional life at a Paper company named Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                There are quite a few well established actors in the show like Steve Carell as Micheal Scott who is the manager of the Scranton Branch, and loves to annoy his employees and sometimes unintentionally offends them with his humor. There are quite a few characters in the show but we wouldn't want to spoil the fun for anyone now, do we? So let's begin with the data visualization...

                                Two different data sets are used to support this data visualization project. Both are acquired from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"> Kaggle</a>, an online data science community where users can find and posts data sets. The following are the two data sets that are used :

                                        The data was scrapped from IMDb, an online entertainment information database. It includes <b>'9 columns'</b>, or what is called as <b>'Variables'</b>. It has information such as the name of the series, the year the title was released, content rating, IMDb ratings, Rotten Tomato ratings, genre, number of seasons the series has, description and the platform its currently streaming on. Each variable has around <b>'12,000 rows'</b> or <b>'Observations'</b>. For the purpose of this project we will be using just the title and the ratings variable and its observations from this data set.

The variables are catagorized into seasons, episode title, description, individual episode ratings, votes and viewership count in USA for the said episode, guest star name (if any), duration of the episode, directors and the writers names. This data set would be used to explore more of the behind-the-scene questions I have about the series.

                                        In this section we will compare The Office to 19 other popular TV shows in terms of IMDb ranking, both from a mix genre category and from comedy genre category.

                                <h3>Where does The Office stand in terms of ranking with 19 other popular TV shows? </h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        To visualize this, we will be using a simple horizontal bar graph. This diagram would be the most appropriate for this question as we are only concerned with 2 variables, the title and the overall IMDb ranking for the series.
                                    </p>

                                        In the visualization above, the x-axis encodes the ratings for titles present in the y-axis. 
                                        The 19 other tv shows are curated from an online top 20 list of must watch TV shows.
                                        When we compare The office with these 19 popular TV shows, it ranks 5th sharing its place with Friends (1994), with 8.9/10 ratings on IMDb. The first 4 top rated series are as follows - Breaking Bad, Game of thrones, The Sopranos and Sherlock.
                                    </p>

                                        Since this question is similar to the one before, we would use a horizontal bar graph for this too. Again the variables are same as above with the only difference being the title having the same genre i.e. Comedy. The other 19 best comedy tv shows of all time is curated from <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/arts/television/best-tv-comedies-shows.html" >The New York Times 21 best comedies of the 21st Century</a>.

                                        In the Comedy category the Office ranks first with 8.9 IMDb ratings. A similar mockumentary called "Parks and Recreation" ranks 4th from top with a rating of 8.6/10.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In conclusion, I think its safe to say that The Office really is the most amazing (and Top rated) comedy series of all time.

                                        In this sections we will try to explore patterns in the viewership count in USA, Impact of celebrity appearance (if any) and find out how many of the actors also wrote and directed the episodes in the series.

                                        To better understand the Viewership count in the US and explore any patterns in the count. The most appropriate visualization type for this would be a line chart.
                                    </p>

                                    The average viewership for season 1 was 6.4 million. As the season progresses, the viewer count picks up reaching over 8.2 million viewers tuning in to watch the TV show. The upward trend continues till season 5, it being the most watched season having almost 8.8 million viewer count. It was also the longest running season out of the 9, consisting a total of 28 episodes.

                                    After season 5 the graph follows a downward trend. By season 7 the average viewers dropped by 1.5 million reaching 7.3 million. After season 7 the count drops drastically reaching 5.4 million, lower than season 1. 
                                    Season 7 is also the season where Steve Carell a.k.a Micheal Scott leaves the Office due to expiration of the contract. His absence can be one of the factor for the drop in viewers, him being the important central character in the series.<br>
                                    By season 9, the viewership had reached the lowest of average viewer count of around 4.2 million.

                                    Like any popular series, The Office had a fair share of well known celebrity appearances.

                                    The visualization above is called a matrix plot. 
                                    The squares on the matrix is known as a square mark. The color and the size of the mark encodes the rating for the episode and the average viewercount respectively.

                                    Amy Adams appeared twice in the show i.e. in episode 5 and episode 9.
                                    According to the matrix plot, episode number 77 with Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman had a total of around 23 million viewer count and was also the most rated (9.8) of the lot.

                                    One of the most interesting fact that I came across while watching the Office was finding out many of the actors from the series, along with acting also wrote and directed a number of episodes. I have been curious ever since to find out who among the cast wrote and directed most of the episodes. To analyse this, the visualization we will be using is the scatter plot.

                                    <img src="./images/Viz Pngs/Writer and actor.png" alt="Treemap for actors who also wrote and directed the episodes" title="Actors who also wrote and directed the episodes">

                                <p>
                                    The Scatter plot has x-axis representing the number of episodes that the cast member has written and y-axis representing the number of episodes that the cast member has directed. The coor of the circle denotes the actors name and the number below the circles on the plot denotes the total number of episodes the actor has appeared in.

                                    In conclusion, Mindy Kaling has written and directed most episodes out of the cast, while also acting in the series and Paul Lieberstein has directed most of the episodes amongst the lot.

                                    John Krasinski and Rainn Wilson both have directed 2 episodes each while acting in all 201 episode.

                            The computers on the Dunder Mifflin office set were wired for the internet. Cast members admitted that when they're in the background of scenes, they were often checking e-mail and surfing the net.

                            Four of the regularly appearing secondary characters have the same first name as the actress or actor who plays her or him: Angela (Angela Kinsey), Oscar (Oscar Nuñez), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith), and Creed (Creed Bratton). Interestingly, Creed shares his entire name (and a large chunk of his history) with his character. They are both called "Creed Bratton".

                            For their goodbye scene at the airport in Carell’s last episode, Jenna Fischer was told by production to, “Just say whatever you would want to say to Steve. Just say goodbye and we'll tape it and when you're finished, just give each other a hug and go your separate ways.’” Fischer later revealed in 2018 that, “Those were real tears and a real goodbye.”
