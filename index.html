                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Water pollution and air quality are two major environmental issues that that India faces at a large extent. The major contributor to this pollution are the Industries. One of the most industrialized and populated state in India is Maharashtra, which is also my home state. I want to visualize various cites from 5 states including Maharashtra, to map out which cities have cleaner air and water for the year 2021. The other 4 states are selected on the basis of water resources in that state. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data set used in this project is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cityapiio/world-cities-air-quality-and-water-polution" target="_blank"> Kaggle.</a> It is curated by City-api.io. It includes 5 variables namely - Name of the City, Region (State), Country, Air Quality and Water pollution.
                    <br>
                    Each of these variables have over 3700 unique values. For the purpose of this project, the data will be filtered to just include Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh and the cities that come under them.
                    <br>
                    The air quality and water pollution index are marked from a scale of 0 to 100 for easier reading.

                    The data is visualized above as a Scatter plot. The x-axis denotes the Air Quality Index (out of 100) and the y-axis denotes the Water pollution (out of 100). The outline of the circles while hovering is computed by converting the scale for Water Pollution index to match the Air Quality Index and averaging it. If the value is <i>above average</i> its denoted by a <i>Green</i> stroke and if it's <i>below average</i> it's <i>Red.</i> This is done to get the overall condition of the city at a glance.

                    The range denotation is given below.
                    <br>
                    Air Quality: <b>0 (very bad)</b> - 100 (very good)
                    <br>
                    Water Pollution: 0 (no pollution) - <b>100 (extreme pollution)</b>

                    <h4>Some important points.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uttar Pradesh has two cities on the extremes with respect to Water pollution, with Aligarh having 0 water pollution and Greater Noida having 100% of water pollution. This also makes Aligarh the only city with above average value for both the variables</li>
                        <li>Ulhasnagar and Chandrapur in Maharashtra and Noida in Uttar Pradesh are three cities with 11 (very poor) air quality index.  </li>
                        <li>Out of 51 cities from 5 different states only 13 cities have comparatively better air quality and clean water resources. </li>
                        <li>Satara, Latur in Maharashtra and Pathanamthitta, Palakkad in Kerala have the cleanest air out of the lot.</li>
